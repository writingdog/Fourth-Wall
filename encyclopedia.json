			[Grant units are thyristors, a kind of semiconductor that acts as a bistable switch. This is a real technology, however, Grant thyristors have special uses in regulating circuits with high degrees of thermal energy. They do not reduce heat on their own, but they make thermal management easier. The [[Uxzu]] considered these to be theoretical, using a [[dissipating filter]] instead.],
			[Grant units are composed of a filter joined to a resonating circuit, and are primarily made of silicon dioxide. They are an important component of many Star Patrol systems, and most engineers are well-versed in their employment. Grant units operated in parallel generate induced interference, increasing with the cube of the power frequency, which must be taken into account when designing circuits.],
