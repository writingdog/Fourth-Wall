It is not a choose your own adventure! Most readers will experience the same story! But you can still impact it by making particular choices to 'nudge' the story a little. At certain intervals, you'll be able to nudge the story in a particular direction. If you don't, the story continues normally &#038;mdash; an 'un-nudged' story is left exactly as I originally wrote it. If you do, it may change subtly based on the results of your choices. Additionally, you will occasionally see highlighted text that you can click on. In this story, they take the form of: [[worldbuilding hints|1]], [[translations|2]], and [[references|3]]. I hope that this is helpful to you in getting the most out of this story :) Enjoy!&lt;/i&gt;[n]***[n]&#038;ldquo;Left engine: fire. Left engine: fire. Left engine —&#038;rdquo;[n]It had all happened very, very suddenly. Fine on the approach. Perfect initial burn. Then —[n]&#038;ldquo;Low coolant warning on the port tank,&#038;rdquo; my engineer added helpfully. That was Kosh, always helpful. &#038;ldquo;Thermal stress on the inboard gauges.&#038;rdquo;[n]&#038;ldquo;Great,&#038;rdquo; I said. I&#038;rsquo;d already pulled the handle for the fire extinguishers; &#038;lsquo;thermal stress&#038;rsquo; could mean anything from a spreading fire to the normal heat and friction of the atmosphere trying to have its way with my wings. &#038;ldquo;Fire&#038;rsquo;s out, though. I think.&#038;rdquo;[n]&#038;ldquo;Think we can make Dessau?&#038;rdquo;[n]With thrust from only one engine, we&#038;rsquo;d started a gentle list. I trimmed us back level, and tapped my hand over the center console to bring up a map of the terrain below us. Our destination was a disconcertingly long way off. &#038;ldquo;Maybe. See what&#038;rsquo;s closer?&#038;rdquo;[n]Kosh nodded, and flicked on his radio. &#038;ldquo;Hanford center, this is Whiskey Two-Six-Two, we may need a new landing site…&#038;rdquo;[n]&#038;ldquo;Go ahead, Two-Six-Two.&#038;rdquo;[n]&lt;i&gt;Hey, our radio&#038;rsquo;s working&lt;/i&gt;. I let myself celebrate that small victory, the way you have to do sometimes. Kosh kept talking. &#038;ldquo;We&#038;rsquo;re headed to Dessau via [[delta-five, delta-one-seven, delta-three-three|4]]. Current altitude is nine-zero kilometers. But we&#038;rsquo;ve lost an engine, and are likely to come down sooner rather than later.&#038;rdquo;[n]&#038;ldquo;Understood, Whiskey Two-Six-Two. Are you declaring an emergency?&#038;rdquo;[n]Kosh looked to me. I looked to him, and then I looked at my control panel, where things had settled back down — if you ignored the sullen red lights that marked my smoldering port thruster. I shook my head.[n]&#038;ldquo;Negative, Hanford, we can hold it for now.&#038;rdquo;[n]They settled on Arnby, a little [[factory town|5]] that was, like many of them, out in the middle of God&#038;rsquo;s own nowhere. I checked the navigational plot and, like he didn&#038;rsquo;t trust me or something, Kosh went over them himself.[n]&#038;ldquo;Doable,&#038;rdquo; he said.</content><nudges><nudge><inline>true</inline><default>true</default><text>&#038;ldquo;Gee, I&#038;rsquo;m glad you agree.&#038;rdquo; We had a few minutes to wait; rather than getting too comfortable, I let myself stress out a bit by bringing up the diagnostic display for our ship.
